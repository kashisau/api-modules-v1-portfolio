# Portfolio
## API service

Allows portfolio data to be retrieved from the server and displayed to the user (based on whatever business logic is in place). For the time being, this is a read-only service. Creation, updates and deletion of portfolio content are handled directly (although of course, with plans to extend this).

## API Methods
